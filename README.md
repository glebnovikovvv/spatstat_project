## Project Title: Spatial Analysis of Restaurants Locations

### Overview
This project presents a comprehensive spatial analysis report developed using Python (with Geopandas) and R. It builds on my final year dissertation, which was graded as exceptional, achieving a score of 82%.The analysis focuses on understanding what affects the location choices of different types of restaurants.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Integrated two separate datasets containing 84,000 and 180,000 observations to analyze small business locations.
- **Advanced Statistical Methods**: Employed a range of techniques to identify spatial patterns, including:
  - **Ripley’s K Function**: To explore the concentration-repulsion tendencies.
  - **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: To visualize density variations across regions.
  - **Moran’s I**: To assess spatial autocorrelation and clustering.
  - **Ellipses**: For visualizing distributions and relationships in spatial data.
  - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: To evaluate the performance of classification models after being fed the population data.
